# Solidity Verifier ðŸš§

To better understand this chapter, it's important to go over the starknet architecture chapter for a fundamental understanding and overview of the flow of the architecture. 

Let's also discuss the following concepts to have the foundational knowledge of this topic.

#### Verifiers 
Smart contracts whichs verifies and checks the validity of a proof. These smart contracts can be L1 verifiers or L2 verifiers.

#### Sequencers 
Sequencers are responsible for ordering and batching transactions on the StarkNet network. They play a vital role in ensuring the scalability and security of the network.


#### Provers 
Provers are responsible for generating proofs that verify the correctness of transactions and state transitions on the StarkNet network. These proofs are used to secure the network and ensure that all transactions are processed correctly. 

#### STARK 
StarkNet provers use a cryptographic technique called STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge) to generate proofs. STARK proofs are a type of zero-knowledge proof, which means that they can be used to prove that something is true without revealing any additional information.
